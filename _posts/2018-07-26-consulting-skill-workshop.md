## 二、背景
　　记得入职的时候，和我一起面试的小伙伴还问了TW和外包公司的区别，其实说到底是性质的区别。作为一个公司的Consultant，一直以来在做delivery的事情，刚好前段时间公司提供了培训机会，就报名参与了这个两天的Consulting Skills Training。  

　　中间涉及到很多技巧，比如准备跟客户的初始会议、收集你想要的信息，如何对客户说"不"。但是当时笔者很少直接跟客户交流需求，从高层次了解客户背后的痛点，一直没有太多感触；而现在刚好有一个项目从头开始，也正好用到了当时培训的一些技巧。

　　趁着还不算太久远，赶紧记录下来，以便以后回顾。

注意：
>部分内容还是会保留英文。

## 三、概述

　　workshop开始，先暖场。先给每个人分发一张纸，写下自己的名字
角色和自己期望的收获。然后找到自己从来没有一起工作的人，交换A4纸，向他解释A4纸的内退。然后通过大家相互介绍的方式，介绍在场的各位。
